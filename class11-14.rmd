  geom_jitter(height = 0.1, width = 0.1, alpha = 0.1) +
  geom_smooth(method = "lm", se = FALSE)

#potential outcome is what you would do in one situation and another situation
```

## how do we interpret these numbers 

```{r}

model <- glm(dvote ~ female, data = x, family = "binomial")

print(model)
summary(model)
        
model %>% 
  tidy()

#lm extends beyond 0 and 1, but glm limits it to between 0 and 1
```

## graphical relationship bewteen dvote and female

```{r}
x %>%
  ggplot(aes(female, dvote)) + 
  geom_jitter(height = 0.1, width = 0.1, alpha = 0.1) + 
  geom_smooth(method = "glm", se = FALSE)

```
